This is a Exploratory Data Analysis portfolio project.

## Goal
Demonstrate my skills at performing exploratory data analysis (data profiling, data cleaning, univariate/bivariate analysis, feature engineering) to provide descriptive statistics from the raw data (thus demonstrating a simple ETL process) and present them in a simple dashboard (thus demonstrating data visualization).

## About the data
The so called 'Kaggle coffee dataset' is real data from ICO regarding coffee production and consumption worldwide.
The data is available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yamaerenay/ico-coffee-dataset-worldwide) under a [Community Data License Agreement](https://cdla.dev/sharing-1-0/).
